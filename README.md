#Milestone Project: User-Centric Frontend Development (HTML5 / CSS3)
The scope for the first project was to create a website for a band (The Monkees) and to include various media elements such as pictures, audio, and video, as well as a contact page and links to various social media pages.

I decided to go outside of the breif and create a fan site for Harry Potter. Oweing to this being my first project I decided to go with a theme which I felt I could deliver better than the proposed idea. 

-----
##UX
This site has been designed to give brief overview of Harry Potter. Harry Potter is a huge subject to cover but I believe I have managed to structure the site to contain enough information to various users. It touches on various aspects, from videos of attaractions, character information and audibook links. The site services the following user types:

-Users that have no previous knowledge of the characters that are looking to understand what the series is all about and get in touch

-Users with some general knowledge of  book series, but looking for more information on the attractions are available.

-Users familiar with the book series but that perhabs struggle to read or have no interest in reading so can find links to audiobooks.

Adobe XD was used to create wireframes for each of the pages both in Desktop and Mobile formats.

##Features
The following is a summary of the features already in place and those that could perhaps be implemented in the future.
###Existing Features
All images on the 'meet the characters' page are hyperlinks to their full-sized versions and open in new tabs.
This allows users to get more detail from any image rather than relying on the smaller versions in the site. 

YouTube videos and Audiobook samples are directly embedded in the site.
Users can watch videos from attractions and listen to samples from eight audiobooks without the need to leave the site.

the 'contact' page contains externals links to other related sites.
This allows users to access more information on the Harry Potter series merchandise, and the social media pages for J K Rowling, Pottermore and Official UK Harry Potter facebook. 

Contact form validates that information has been entered into each field in the expected format before allowing submission.
This prevents users from accidentally attempting to submit blank or otherwise incomplete contact information.

###Features to consider for future implementation.
Contact form information isnâ€™t saved or emailed to any location, this was outside the scope of this project.
