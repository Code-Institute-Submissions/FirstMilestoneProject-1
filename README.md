# Milestone Project: User-Centric Frontend Development (HTML5 / CSS3)
This project is purely for educational purposes. The scope for the first project was to create a website for a band (The Monkees) and to include various media elements such as pictures, audio, and video, as well as a contact page and links to various social media pages.

I decided to go outside of the breif and create a fan site for Harry Potter. Oweing to this being my first project I decided to go with a theme which I felt I could deliver better than the proposed idea. 

-----

## UX
This site has been designed to give brief overview of Harry Potter. Harry Potter is a huge subject to cover but I believe I have managed to structure the site to contain enough information for various users. It touches on various aspects, from videos of attaractions, character information and audibook links. The site services the following user types:

<ul>
<li>Users that have no previous knowledge of the characters that are looking to understand what the series is all about and get in touch</li>

<li>Users with some general knowledge of series, but looking for more information on the attractions are available.</li>

<li>Users familiar with the series but that perhaps struggle to read or have no interest in reading so can find links to audiobooks.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Adobe XD was used to create [wireframes](https://github.com/ElizabethD123/FirstMilestoneProject/tree/master/Wireframes) for each of the pages both in Desktop and Mobile formats.

## Features
The following is a summary of the features already in place and those that could perhaps be implemented in the future.
### Existing Features
All images are hyperlinks to their full-sized versions and open in new tabs.
This allows users to get more detail from any image rather than relying on the smaller versions in the site. 

YouTube videos and Audiobook samples are directly embedded in the site.
Users can watch videos from attractions and listen to samples from seven audiobooks without the need to leave the site.

the 'contact' page contains externals links to other related sites.
This allows users to access more information on the Harry Potter series merchandise, and the social media pages for J K Rowling, Pottermore and Official UK Harry Potter facebook. 

Contact form validates that information has been entered into each field in the expected format before allowing submission.
This prevents users from accidentally attempting to submit blank or otherwise incomplete contact information.

### Features to consider for future implementation.
Contact form information isnâ€™t saved or emailed to any location, this is outside the scope of this project.

## Technologies used

Brief overview of the languages, frameworks, and other tools I've used on this project:

[html5](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/)
Semantic markup language as the shell of the site.

[CSS3](https://www.w3.org/standards/techs/css#w3c_all)
Cascading Style Sheets as the design of the site.

[Bootstrap v 4.2.1"](http://www.getbootstrap.com)
Grid layout allows for a responsive layout across various platforms. Also allowed me to style the site with less need to write extensive CSS styling. 

[JavaScript](http://wwww.javascript.com)
Used for open/close effect on mobile navbar & carousel.

[Font Awesome 5](https://fontawesome.com/)
Use of social media icons.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
Used for heading fonts on site.

## Deployment
The site has been deployed using GitHub Pages and is available to review here: https://elizabethd123.github.io/FirstMilestoneProject/

Local deployment is not required.

## Testing

### Test Matrix
I created a testing matrix in Excel. It outlines the various tests I made to ensure the the site is responsive to different device sizes, renders correctly and functioanlity is operational.

### Compatability
The site has been tested on the below browsers for compatability and responsiveness. 

<ul>
<li>Chrome
<li>Firefox
<li>Safari
<li>Internet Explorer
</ul>

NOTED ISSUES

IE: Doesn't support GRID, so the entire site breaks.

Meet the Characters page has long load time.

on EDGE the HTML5 audio tag numbers look small
